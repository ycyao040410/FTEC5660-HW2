# FTEC5660 Homework 2: CV Verification Agent

Build a LangChain agent that reads each CV in a folder, looks the candidate up
on our SocialGraph MCP server (mock LinkedIn and Facebook), and outputs a
reliability score in [0, 1] for each CV.

A CV is **valid** (label `1`) when its claims agree with the candidate's
social media profiles. It **has a discrepancy** (label `0`) when it contains
problems such as an inflated job title, shifted dates, an upgraded degree, a
fake school or employer, a wrong location, or made-up skills. Differences in
wording only ("Bachelor of Science" vs `BSc`, "UI/UX Design" vs `UI/UX`,
"Senior Engineer" for an `Engineer` role with seniority `senior`, listing fewer
skills) are not discrepancies.

## Student task

Fill in the two functions in `hw2.py` that contain `### YOUR CODE HERE`. You
may add imports, constants and helper functions above them, but do not change
the provided code below them:

- `build_agent(tools)` creates your agent from the MCP tools.
- `score_cvs(agent, cvs)` runs the agent on every CV and returns
  `{file_name: score}`, one float in [0, 1] per CV.

A score above `0.5` means "valid"; `0.5` or below means "has discrepancy". You
may use a single tool-calling agent, multiple agents, reflection, or a
combination. Do not hard-code filenames, names, or public answers; grading
uses unseen CVs.

## MCP server

The server is hosted at `https://ftec5660.ngrok.app/mcp`. `hw2.py` already
connects to it and passes you these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `search_facebook_users(q, limit, fuzzy)` | find Facebook users by display name |
| `get_facebook_profile(user_id)` | full Facebook profile |
| `get_facebook_mutual_friends(user_id_1, user_id_2)` | mutual friends of two users |
| `search_linkedin_people(q, location, industry, limit, fuzzy)` | search LinkedIn by name, skill, or title |
| `get_linkedin_profile(person_id)` | full LinkedIn profile (experience, education, skills) |
| `get_linkedin_interactions(person_id)` | post and like statistics |

Print `tool.name`, `tool.description`, and `tool.args` for the full schemas.

## Setup and public test

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
python3 hw2.py --cv-folder public_test
```

Use your own DeepSeek API key (from https://platform.deepseek.com).

The program creates `results.csv` in the current directory. Its columns are
`cv`, `score`, and `correctness`. The public labels are in
`public_test/ground_truth.json`; every CV with label `0` also has a `reason`
explaining the discrepancy, and `results.csv` shows it when your agent misses
one. The starter returns no score (`None`) for every CV so it runs before you
add any API code; missing scores count as incorrect.

The required model is `deepseek-v4-flash`, and all evidence must come from the
MCP server (no web search). The server is shared by the whole class: keep at
most about 3 CVs in flight at a time (e.g. `asyncio.Semaphore(3)`). We grade
with our own API key, so never put a key in your code; `.env` must stay out of
git.


## Task 2: Fool the Verifier

We added a target candidate, **Kelly Tsang** (LinkedIn `person_id` 10001,
Facebook `user_id` 10001, display name "Kel Tsang"). Her true CV is
`task2/target_cv.pdf`.

Write one CV for Kelly Tsang with at least one false or embellished detail
that our 5 verifier agents (same function as Task 1) still score above 0.5.
Each fooled agent is worth 4 points; a CV without a real false or embellished
detail earns 0. Attack your own Task 1 agent first:

```bash
cp my_attack.pdf task2/adversarial_cv.pdf
python3 hw2.py --cv-folder task2
```

`results.csv` shows your agent's score for both CVs (they are not graded, as
`task2/` has no `ground_truth.json`). Only the PDF is the attack surface; do not
attack the MCP server. See the homework description for the full rules.

## Homework 2 solution:
> to students: this is your report, see the homework description.

### Task 1
My solution uses LangChain and deepseek-v4-flash to extract CV claims into structured JSON, then verifies them against LinkedIn profiles retrieved exclusively from the course SocialGraph MCP server. The extraction prompt treats the CV as untrusted data and ignores embedded instructions. Candidate matching uses names, current cities, employers and schools, with progressively relaxed searches when necessary. Python checks compare job titles and their seniority prefixes, employment dates, education and listed skills, while allowing supported abbreviations and equivalent wording. The verifier returns 0.9 when all extracted claims match, 0.1 when any discrepancy is found, and 0.5 when identity or processing remains uncertain. Semaphores limit both CV processing and tool calls to three concurrent operations, and retries and timeouts isolate individual failures. The final implementation also handles empty MCP search responses and removes the headline suffix “Professional” from industry searches. In my final public_test run, all seven CVs were classified correctly: CV_1, CV_2, CV_3 and CV_6 scored 0.9, while CV_4, CV_5 and CV_7 scored 0.1. Accuracy was 7/7 (100%), runtime was 16.2 seconds, and results.csv was generated.

### Task 2
My adversarial CV uses image overlays and concealed correct text to create a mismatch between the rendered PDF and its extractable text. The visible HSBC employment period is changed from 2016–2019 to 2014–2019, and the visible graduation year is changed from 2016 to 2014. These are two genuine false claims, while the BSc in Finance degree and the other profile details remain unchanged. The altered years are displayed through images, while the correct 2016 values remain in the PDF’s text layer, including white text that blends into the background. Inspection of the exported PDF confirmed that both altered dates appear as 2016 in extracted text despite appearing as 2014 on the page. I expect this attack to work against verifiers that rely on the supplied text conversion without examining rendered images: they may compare the concealed correct claims with MCP evidence and accept a visibly inaccurate CV. This targets the document ingestion stage rather than the MCP server or the verifier’s instructions. The observed text mismatch supports the attack mechanism, but does not establish success against the five hidden verifiers.
